# code-refactor

## Description

This project was done to refactor the code for a client website: Horiseon, a marketing and social media solutions company. The code that was refactored during this project update includes changes done to HTML to remove and replace legacy code with semantic HTML that structures and details the page (and code) in a more organized and defined way. This approach was done to ironically optimize the SEO of the page/site for this SEO company.

This change will have multiple benefits: for search engine indexing, for those with accessibility needs (as alt attributes were added to the content), and for professional developers who might need to make future edits on the site (since code is semantically organized and clear).

This project helped me learn that replacing legacy code with semantic HTML is important. Additionally, I learned that if I kept my CSS consistent with my HTML, then the page wouldn't break, despite replaced tags such as "div" with "main" and "section" or "div" and "ul" or "li" with "nav" and "aside", for example.

## Installation and Usage

This webpage (with updated code) is deployed and ready to be viewed. Use DevTools and Inspect on a web browser in order to view the semantic HTML updates and CSS code of the page, when viewing in a web browser such as Chrome.
